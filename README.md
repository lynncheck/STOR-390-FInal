### Background

In Dr.Chaovalitwongse, Ph.D student Ya-Ju Fan, and Dr.Sachdeoâ€™s research, outlined their methodology and mathmatical execution to create a prediction model that can read in electroencephalogram (EEG) data and classify if the patient is in a normal state or preseizure state. Their goal is to determine distinctive characteristics that can be used to classify different states of brain activities to help detect onset epileptic seizures. This paper analyzes and assess thier methodology. Through the lens
