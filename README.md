### Background

In Dr.Chaovalitwongse, Ph.D student Ya-Ju Fan, and Dr.Sachdeoâ€™s research, outlined their methodology and mathematical execution to create a prediction model that can read in electroencephalogram (EEG) data and classify if the patient is in a normal state or pre-seizure state. Their goal is to determine distinctive characteristics that can be used to classify different states of brain activities to help detect onset epileptic seizures. This paper analyzes and assesses their methodology. Through the deontological lens, the execution of their research will be analyzed, considering the ethical and moral aspects of the study.
